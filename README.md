<h2>Greetings and Welcome!<h2>

Here are all of the HTML and CSS documents in my Palila website for my Sophomore Biology class.

It's a very simple/bare-bones website but it would be an excellent project for anyone that's a beginner at HTML or CSS.

So, whether you are here because you have seen the website or because you are looking for some simple code to change around/play with, I hope you have a fabulous time.

Sincerely,

Sophia
